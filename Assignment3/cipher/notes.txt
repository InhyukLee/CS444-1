0. build kernel with following command prior to make -j4 all
	source /scratch/opt/environment-setup-i586-poky-linux.csh
	make -j4 all 
	or (at TA request.)
	make -j16 all

1. place Makefile and sbd_enc.c in a build directory that doesnt contain a kernel (this make file will only work on os-class)

2. In your kernel terminal run: 
	source /scratch/opt/environment-setup-i586-poky-linux.csh
	qemu-system-i386 -redir tcp:5637::22 -nographic -kernel linux-yocto-3.14/arch/x86/boot/bzImage -drive file=core-image-lsb-sdk-qemux86.ext3 -enable-kvm -usb -localtime --no-reboot --append "root=/dev/hda rwconsole=ttyS0 debug"

3. In scp/build terminal run (WHEN KERNEL IS RUNNING):
	make
	scp -P 5637 sbd_enc.ko root@localhost:~
	scp -P 5637 demoscript root@localhost:~

4. Once files have been Scp'ed into the kernel run demo script

DemoScript notes:
Because its easy to forget things during a demo I've made a script with the following commands

./demoscript setup
	inserts the module, sets all of the block devices data to zero, then mounts the device.

./demoscript setup thisIsMySuperSecetKey
	does the same as above, but edits module paramter for your key.

./demoscript teardown
	rmmods the module, and unmounts the block device.

./demoscript demo
	runs the demo itself through the use of grep and cat commands.

./demoscript listkey
	lists the key used for encryption. If nothing is found or two keys are displayed use the following command:
	dmesg -c
	and run:
	./demoscript demo
